<p>Feel free to register for an administrator account. The team scenario is simple: You work for a famous security house, AcmeSec LLC, as a member of an overworked but dedicated team of administrators that maintain and monitor the systems on a daily basis.</p>
<p>You regularly have access to a variety of systems ranging from corporate web, mail and telephony servers to intrusion detection systems and test servers at your disposal, however, there is a catch…</p>
<p>At this moment you are far away from your workplace accompanied by your colleagues (attending a security conference - perhaps AthCon ?!?!), when all hell breaks loose. A massive wave of skillful hackers attacks AcmeSec's corporate networks, while you are unable to deal directly with the attacks. Your best friend in this war is the abuse department of your IP provider (CTF Committee) in conjunction with emergency security tools that you have in place.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 1.1em">Prizes</strong>
<p>Since you can't log in with your ssh keys, your boss - in order to motivate you - has offered the following prizes… <small>(note: These are actual prizes that you will get)</small></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st place:</strong> A Metasploit Pro license worth $15.000</li>
<li><strong>2nd place:</strong> A Netsparker Pro license worth $5.950</li>
<li><strong>3rd place:</strong> A Burpsuite Pro License worth $300</li>
</ul>

<strong>Rules</strong>
<p>First and foremost, this is just for fun. The scope of this year's CTF is to allow both attackers and by-standers to take part. You will be able to see from the inside how an attack looks like. Please take the time to read the rules of the game.</p>
